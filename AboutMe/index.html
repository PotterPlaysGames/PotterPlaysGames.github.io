			<h2>About Me</h2>
		</header>
		<div class="box">
			<p>Hey everyone! I'm <strong>Aidan Potter</strong>, the creator of Potter Programming Technologies. Currently, I'm a Computer Science student at Clarion University. So, yeah, coding and tech stuff—that's my jam.</p>

			<p>I decided to create this website as a kind of blog where I can share my journey, projects, and thoughts on programming and gaming. Yep, you heard right, gaming's another passion of mine. Whether it's first-person shooters or strategy games, I'm all in.</p>

			<p>Speaking of programming, I'm particularly interested in web development and machine learning. I'm still learning, always exploring new languages and frameworks. It's like an ongoing quest, and man, it never gets boring.</p>

			<p>When I'm not in the "code mode," you can catch me on Reddit, TikTok, or Facebook. Social media's how I chill—about a quarter to a third of my day, actually. It's a great way to unwind and catch up on everything from memes to world events.</p>

			<p>I get a lot of my learning from real-world assignments. Writing isn't my strongest suit, but I’ve had to grind out essays and research papers in school. They’ve taught me a thing or two about focusing and getting the job done.</p>

			<p>If any of this resonates with you, or if you’re curious about coding, gaming, or just want to say hi, feel free to connect with me on social media. Links are down below. Looking forward to chatting with you!</p>
